⏱ Time & Space Complexity
Time Complexity

Loop over array → O(n)

HashMap operations → O(1) average

✅ Total: O(n)

Space Complexity

HashMap me worst case n elements
✅ O(n)     


🗣️ How to Explain Logic (What you say first)

Tum bolo:

“We need to find the frequency of each element in the array.
For this, I’m using a HashMap where the key stores the element
and the value stores how many times it appears.”

“I iterate through the array once.
For every element, I check if it already exists in the map.
If yes, I increment its count.
If not, I insert it with count 1.”

“Finally, I traverse the map to print each element with its frequency.”
