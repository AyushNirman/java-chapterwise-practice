# 🟢 Question: First Repeating Element (Using HashSet – Left to Right)

---

## 📌 Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, find the **first repeating element** while traversing the array **from left to right**.

> First repeating means: the **first element that appears again** while scanning the array.

---

## 📥 Input

```text
[10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6]
```

## 📤 Output

```text
3
```

---

## 🧠 Approach Used

**HashSet**

---

## ✅ Logic (Step-by-Step)

1. Create a `HashSet` to store elements already seen
2. Traverse the array from **left to right**
3. For each element:

   * If element is already in HashSet → **this is the first repeating element**
   * Return it immediately
4. If traversal ends and no repeat found → return `-1`

---

## 💻 Java Code (With IMPORTANT COMMENTS)

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

class Solution {

    public static int firstRepeatingElement(int[] arr) {

        // HashSet to store elements we have seen
        HashSet<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();

        // Traverse array from left to right
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {

            // IMPORTANT STEP:
            // If element already exists in HashSet,
            // it means this is the first repeating element
            if (seen.contains(arr[i])) {
                return arr[i];   // return immediately
            }

            // Mark element as seen
            seen.add(arr[i]);
        }

        // No repeating element found
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6};
        System.out.println(firstRepeatingElement(arr));
    }
}
```

## ⭐ IMPORTANT NOTES (COMMENT THESE IN COMPILER / INTERVIEW)

```text
- HashSet stores only unique elements
- contains() and add() work in O(1) time
- Returning immediately ensures first repetition
- Order matters in this problem
```

---

## ⏱ Time Complexity (TC)

```text
O(n)
```

### Why?

* Single loop over array
* HashSet operations are O(1)

---

## 📦 Space Complexity (SC)

```text
O(n)
```

### Why?

* HashSet may store all elements in worst case

---

## 🚨 VERY IMPORTANT INTERVIEW POINT

⚠️ This approach finds:

> **First duplicate encountered**

❌ It does NOT always give:

> **First repeating element by earliest index**

Example:

```text
[10, 5, 3, 4, 3, 5, 6]
```

* Output using this method → **3**
* Correct first repeating element → **5**

👉 To fix this, interviewer may expect **right-to-left traversal**

---

## 🗣 How to Explain in Interview (Short)

> “I use a HashSet and traverse left to right.
> If an element is already present, I return it as the first repeating element.
> Time complexity is O(n) and space complexity is O(n).”
